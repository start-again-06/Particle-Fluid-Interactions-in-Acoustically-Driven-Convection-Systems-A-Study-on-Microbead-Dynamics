#2nd UK Microfluidics System Conference Particle-Fluid-Interactions-in-Acoustically-Driven-Convection-Systems-A-Study-on-Microbead-Dynamics

ðŸ§ª Acoustofluidics with SPH and Acoustic Force Modeling
This repository presents a high-fidelity simulation framework that couples Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with analytical and interpolated acoustic forces to model microbead dynamics in acoustically levitated and thermally driven environments. The application targets advancements in droplet microfluidics, biological analysis, and zero-gravity aerospace research.

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Gor'kov Potential-based Acoustic Force

âœ… FEM-style pressure field interpolation

âœ… 2D SPH simulation with PySPH

âœ… Thermal convection modeling

âœ… Microbead acoustic levitation and motion

âœ… Custom SPH kernel (Cubic Spline) for visualization & density estimation

ðŸ§¬ Methodology:

Acoustic Field Modeling:
Gor'kov potential computed analytically.

FEM-style simulated pressure field exported to CSV.

Gradient of pressure used to compute acoustic force.

SPH Simulation:

Thermal convection handled via *HeatEquationWithSourceScheme*.

Fluids:
Water and Iodixanol (biological medium).

Particles: 
Microbeads subject to gravity, buoyancy, and acoustic forces.

Microbeads Dynamics:
Influenced by both Gor'kov and interpolated FEM-based acoustic forces.

Coupled to local temperature field and buoyancy using Boussinesq approximation.
