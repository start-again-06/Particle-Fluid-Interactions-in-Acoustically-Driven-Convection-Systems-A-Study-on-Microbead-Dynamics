<summary><strong>üìò OVERVIEW</strong></summary>

This repository presents a high-fidelity simulation framework that couples **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)** with analytical and interpolated acoustic forces to model **microbead dynamics** in acoustically levitated and thermally driven environments.

**Application areas include:**
- Droplet microfluidics  
- Biological analysis  
- Zero-gravity aerospace research

<summary><strong>üî¨ METHODOLOGY</strong></summary>

**Acoustic Field Modeling:**
- Gor'kov potential computed analytically  
- FEM-style simulated pressure field exported to CSV  
- Gradient of pressure used to compute acoustic force  

**SPH Simulation:**
- Thermal convection modeled via `HeatEquationWithSourceScheme`  

**Fluids Used:**
- Water  
- Iodixanol (biological medium)  

**Particles:**
- Microbeads subjected to gravity, buoyancy, and acoustic forces  

**Microbead Dynamics:**
- Influenced by both Gor'kov and FEM-interpolated forces  
- Coupled to local temperature field via Boussinesq approximation
